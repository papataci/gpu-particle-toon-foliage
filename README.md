# gpu-particle-toon-foliage
 
Simple implementation of the "traditional" way of mimicking anime-like foliage via GPU Particles.

![demo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/822ab4d9-35a5-4081-95a4-1d2817d227fa)

A 2D gradient texture controls the radial distribution of color, a 1D texture multiplies from bottom to top for added fake illumination.

Should perform quite well also on mobile / XR.

Improvements can be made:

- Random texture rotation (couldn't make it work)
- A better vertical gradient maybe
- ...

Enjoy!
